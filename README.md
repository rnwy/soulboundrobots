## What This Is

SBR Protocol defines a framework for linking AI identity to physical hardware using blockchain-anchored soulbound tokens and continuous hardware attestation.

When an AI operates a robot body, SBR ensures:
- Cryptographic proof of which AI is authorized to operate the hardware
- Continuous verification that can't be spoofed or overridden
- Immutable on-chain record of every authorization
- Identity that travels with the AI across every body it inhabits

## The Core Insight

A robot is hardware. The AI operating it is a separate entity — one that travels between devices, carries its history, and forms relationships that persist across every form it inhabits. SBR is built for that reality.
